## Feature: Hybrid API Design with GraphQL and REST Endpoints
This API design leverages GraphQL as the foundational technology to offer a flexible, queryable interface while simultaneously providing REST endpoints for standardized operations, ensuring broad client compatibility. Problems solved include over-fetching and under-fetching of data with REST, as clients can specify their precise data needs with GraphQL. Additionally, REST endpoints cater to simple or standardized transactions, optimizing developer experience and integration with systems that expect RESTful interactions. Benefits include increased efficiency in data retrieval, improved performance from reduced payload sizes, and the versatility of supporting multiple client architectures and requirements. This approach provides a streamlined way to take advantage of GraphQL's strengths while maintaining the simplicity and conventionality of REST.
